Facebook authentication


This is the React Native final project for Andrew Peterson

    This project is going to be a Favorite Music page 
My idea is to allow people to create a fan page of favorite music.   
1. people will be able to login with thier own username and password to access thier music library. 
2. when they log in, they will be able to see a list of the music they have put in. 
3. from the main page they will be able to add new songs or look at existing songs. 
4. Elements:
    a. Artist/Group Name
        1. for groups list name of people in the group. 
    b. Genre (ie. rock, country, R&B, Classical, etc...)
    c. song title
    d. link to the song
    e. What do you like about the song (how did it inspire you)
    f. Who wrote the song
5. Song Quiz
    a: elements
        1. quiz should pull from the song list database
        2. a song title will be displayed 
        3. people will have to select from a list of 4 artists which one sang that song. 
        4. The game should cover 20 songs or if less than 20 the number of songs in thier list, they would need more than 3 songs to participate. 
        5. track how many questions they were asked and how many they got correct.
